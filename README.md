# M1_Application_Figureprint based Biometric Attendance System

* Attendance systems are commonly used systems to mark the presence in offices and schools. From  manually marking the attendance in attendance registers to using high-tech applications and biometric systems, these systems have improved significantly. In our previous projects, we have covered few other electronic attendance system projects using RFID and AVR microcontroller, 8051 and raspberry Pi. In this project, we used fingerprint Module and Arduino to take and keep attendance data and records. By using fingerprint sensor, the system will become more secure for the users. Following sections explains technical details of making a fingerprint based biometric attendance system using Arduino.
